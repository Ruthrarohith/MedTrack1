# Commands to Push MedTrack to GitHub as MedTrack1

# The repository remote has already been configured to:
# https://github.com/Ruthrarohith/MedTrack1.git

# After creating the repository on GitHub (https://github.com/new),
# run this command to push your code:

git push -u origin main

# If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to:
# 1. Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
# 2. Or configure SSH keys

# Alternative: Force push if needed
# git push -u origin main --force
